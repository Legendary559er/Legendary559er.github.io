	<p>I create works of art that involve questioning my methods of how the subject matter is portrayed and the process of creating it. I have created thousands of photographs and have grown into a well-rounded photographer. I take the time to learn and advance my techniques to create new challenges for myself I create to give wonder and thought to the viewer and try to pay very close attention to detail. I love the elegance of nature, its colors, and the serenity it expels. My preferred medium is natural light in color photography.However, I am adept in multiple mediums.I am always trying to get outdoors or go exploring to find new views. I take time to observe how my image will turn out, by changing perspectives and trying to find the right composition. I pay attention to detail and often end up finding new landscapes for my vision. I would also like to bring awareness to the environments around, while also showcasing the damage we are responsible for causing all the environmental damage and ignoring the issue.</p>
